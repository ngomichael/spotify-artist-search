# What is this project?
- This app displays a Spotify artist’s top 10 tracks, an image of the artist, and other artists related to them. A user has the ability to search for an artist and get information about them back.

# Goal(s) of this project?
- During this time I heard a lot about APIs and wanted to get some exposure interacting with an API. I decided to use Spotify’s API, used jQuery to make GET requests, and focused a lot more on the JavaScript side of things.
